In that times, chicken had teeth ...
and men used to fear them and not to walk alone
helmets for their head protection, gloves for their hands, shoulder bags full of food, bottles of water and jinfaki
Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?
a long gut downward to darkness lit with semi-formed candles of smelling wax, appealing unused sized flying insects resembling to bees, or perhaps yellowjackets
I wanted to know where I could go with this tunnel, looking alike endless, how far down, how far deep in darkness
With each step, the echoes of my soul Reverberate in the chasms of the unknown, Guided by the whispers of unseen winds
The wind’s my guide, whisperin’ the vibe, I rise with the tide, let my spirit collide.
Walkin’ through the dark, where the shadows reside,
But I’m built from the fire, man, I never hide.
The wind’s my guide, whisperin’ the vibe, I rise with the tide, let my spirit collide.
Walkin’ through the dark, where the shadows reside,
But I’m built from the fire, man, I never hide.
"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy"
Hot like a kettle
I'm curious about what it's like to be loved by you, just before I drift off to sleep. It's all I can think about, and I've been dreaming that you feel the same way too.
Straight up, it feels like you’re already living rent-free in my head. Tell me we’re on the same vibe. How’s that for a laid-back, slangy continuation? Let me know if you want to tweak it!
I'm all ears for your thoughts. If there's anything that doesn’t feel right or could be more awesome, just say the word!
A whispered word, Echoes in the quiet room, Meaning takes its flight.
Together in this moment, where we all belong.
It has a warmth to it that resonates—almost like an invitation to be present and unified.

you think we'll just hand you our ?!
You think we’ll just yield? Nah, we stand unbroken, bold, Badges earned, not stolen.
Then you're in for a surprise. We've faced worse and still stood tall, and every tower falls eventually.
How far long?
Whereas once the shadowy, underground chamber had secured ominous creeping with many legged creatures devoid of light and air, now its darkness felt peaceful - quiet and still
The creatures unfolding, folding back their legs appeared floating in an invisible stream, seeming to invite to a discrete door 
to the curious incident of the dog in the night time
mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of Harlots and abominations of the Earth
Caller number one, Hey, man... whats up?
Not a problem, you know I do it 'cause I love you, now I got to give a shoutout to Seagrims Gin 'cause I drink it, and they paying me for it
Paying for drinking, even a Gin, ain't no a stoofy pumpky broco
a description of a boose in island on the empty water planet
tasty sweet silky on the tongue
Whatever it is, it sounds like a delight for the senses.
Baby you got me like ah, woo, ah, don't you stop loving me (loving me)
Only then could you fully understand what it's like.
a velvety whimsical effervescent effect of light in a cavernous shelter
this leads to macabre practices even by children
promptly bash in his head so he can loot his pockets
a widow when she married a man who turned to be abusive
both the men looked at her
No, Quentin admitted
Is it? Why is it?
fuck you, I am not going to cry or beg
breathless and sweating he climbed through the hatchway and stood for a while allowing the cold wind to cool his head and face
the implication was that, while I had succeeded as a prosaic pitiable cloak-manufacturer, he had conquered the world by the magic of his violin and compositions
an hilarious unworthy look he used to show here and there had never been detrimental 
An exaggerated expression caught between absurdity and insignificance—a face contorted in laughter, but in a way that lacks weight or dignity. Perhaps wide, unrestrained eyes, a mouth stretched too far, a crooked smirk hovering between amusement and awkwardness. It’s the look of someone laughing at the wrong time, or with too much force, or at something that shouldn’t be funny at all.
on the drive home, the men sat thinking their own thoughts 
sheep's clear, insistent voice pulls you down into the rabbit hole and doesn't let go
the flame kisses the paper
I always refused politely, saying I meant to keep it as my souvenir of the summer
