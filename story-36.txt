In that times, chicken had teeth ...
and men used to fear them and not to walk alone
helmets for their head protection, gloves for their hands, shoulder bags full of food, bottles of water and jinfaki
Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?
a long gut downward to darkness lit with semi-formed candles of smelling wax, appealing unused sized flying insects resembling to bees, or perhaps yellowjackets
I wanted to know where I could go with this tunnel, looking alike endless, how far down, how far deep in darkness
