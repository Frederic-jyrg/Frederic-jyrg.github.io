"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?”
Brown Bear: (A low growl, perhaps a sigh) I see a long gut downward, to darkness lit with semi-formed candles of smelling wax. I see appealing unused sized flying insects, resembling bees, or perhaps yellowjackets.
"You see the same path I tread. The echoes of my soul reverberate in the chasms of the unknown. Do you feel them too, bear?”
Brown Bear: (Shifts, the sound of claws on stone) The wind whispers things down here. Whispers of a time when chickens had teeth, and men feared the shadows.
"That time feels close, even now. This tunnel... it feels like a memory, a part of that age. Helmets for head protection, gloves for hands, shoulder bags full of food, bottles of water and jinfaki – it feels like we should be armed, even against the darkness itself.”
Brown Bear: The darkness has its own teeth, little human. Sharper than any chicken's. It gnaws at the edges of what is known.
"I wanted to know where I could go with this tunnel, looking alike endless, how far down, how far deep in darkness. Is there an end, bear? Or does it just keep going?”
Brown Bear: Some paths have no end, only deeper shadows. But even in the dark, there is warmth. A warmth that resonates, almost like an invitation to be present and unified.
(A pause, considering) “You speak of warmth in this cold place?”
Brown Bear: The fire is not always seen, little human. Sometimes it burns within. You are built from it, you say. Do not let the darkness extinguish it.
"The wind’s my guide, whisperin’ the vibe. I rise with the tide, let my spirit collide. Walkin’ through the dark, where the shadows reside, but I’m built from the fire, man, I never hide.”
Brown Bear: (A low rumble of agreement) Then walk on, little human. But remember, even the strongest tower falls eventually. What will you find at the end of this long gut?
