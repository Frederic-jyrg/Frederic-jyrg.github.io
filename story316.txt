In that times, chicken had teeth ...
and men used to fear them and not to walk alone
helmets for their head protection, gloves for their hands, shoulder bags full of food, bottles of water and jinfaki
Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?
a long gut downward to darkness lit with semi-formed candles of smelling wax, appealing unused sized flying insects resembling to bees, or perhaps yellowjackets
I wanted to know where I could go with this tunnel, looking alike endless, how far down, how far deep in darkness
With each step, the echoes of my soul Reverberate in the chasms of the unknown, Guided by the whispers of unseen winds
The wind’s my guide, whisperin’ the vibe, I rise with the tide, let my spirit collide.
Walkin’ through the dark, where the shadows reside,
But I’m built from the fire, man, I never hide.
The wind’s my guide, whisperin’ the vibe, I rise with the tide, let my spirit collide.
Walkin’ through the dark, where the shadows reside,

Hot like a kettle
I'm curious about what it's like to be loved by you, just before I drift off to sleep. It's all I can think about, and I've been dreaming that you feel the same way too.
Straight up, it feels like you’re already living rent-free in my head. Tell me we’re on the same vibe. How’s that for a laid-back, slangy continuation? Let me know if you want to tweak it!
I'm all ears for your thoughts. If there's anything that doesn’t feel right or could be more awesome, just say the word!
A whispered word, Echoes in the quiet room, Meaning takes its flight.
Together in this moment, where we all belong.
It has a warmth to it that resonates—almost like an invitation to be present and unified.

you think we'll just hand you our ?!
You think we’ll just yield? Nah, we stand unbroken, bold, Badges earned, not stolen.
Then you're in for a surprise. We've faced worse and still stood tall, and every tower falls eventually.
